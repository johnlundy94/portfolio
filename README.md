# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio highlights the best projects I have been on and created to date. There is also a detailed about me section that dives into my journey starting out as a software developer.
The portfolio was built so that any prospective employer could take a look at my work and get to know me a bit more before bringing me in for an interview!

This portfolio was the first "project" that I worked on with React... and I love it!
